to FALSE. See \code{\link{impute_MissingData}}.}

\item{bound_left}{Numeric integer, the minimum number of non-zero
values to the left of a missing value to be replaced with \code{NA}.
Defaults to 2. See \code{\link{impute_MissingData}}.}

\item{bound_right}{Numeric integer, the minimum number of non-zero
values to the right of a missing value to be replaced with \code{NA}.
Defaults to 2. See \code{\link{impute_MissingData}}.}

\item{remove_SinglePeak}{If TRUE, removes Single Peak. Defaults to FALSE.
see \code{\link{RemoveSinglePeak}}.}

\item{remove_ConsecutivePep}{If TRUE, filters peptides by consecutive
peptide detection. Defaults to TRUE.
See \code{\link{filter_ConsecutivePep}}.}

\item{min_stretch_length}{Numeric integer, the minimal length a stretch of
continuous identifications has to have in order not to be removed.
Defaults to 3. See \code{\link{filter_ConsecutivePep}}.}

\item{scaling}{If TRUE, performs row-wise normalization. Defaults to TRUE.
See \code{\link{scaling_m}}.}

\item{similarity_calculation}{If TRUE, this function first computes the
similarity of protein pairs based on co-elution pattern via one of the
user-defined metrics. It then removes protein pairs below 0.5
similarity score prior to prediction with MLP.Defaults to TRUE.
See \code{\link{similarity_score}}.}

as defined by two to the power of this value. Defaults to 6.
See \code{\link{MLP_m}}.}

\item{powerto2}{Integer, the number of neurons in the subsequent hidden
layer as defined by two to the power of this value.Defaults to 7.
See \code{\link{MLP_m}}.}

\item{drate}{Numeric, the dropout rates.
Defaults to 0.1. See \code{\link{MLP_m}}.}

\item{optimizer}{Name of the optimizer.
For most models, this defaults to "rmsprop".See \code{\link{MLP_m}}.}

\item{plots}{Logical value, indicating whether to plot the performance of
the learning algorithm using k-fold cross-validation; Defaults to FALSE.
These plots are :
\itemize{ \item{pr_plot} - Precision-recall PLOT
\item{roc_plot} - ROC plot
\item{radar_plot} - Radar plot showing
accuracy, F1-score , positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity (SE)
and MCC.}}

\item{cutoff}{An integer range between [0,1] for specifying
the cutoff for classifier confidence score to subset the high-confidence
interactions.Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{csize}{Numerical value, the minimum size of the predicted complexes.
Defaults to 3. See \code{\link{get_clusters}}.}

\item{d}{A number, density of predicted complexes; defaults to 0.3.

overlap between two clusters; defaults to 0.8.
See \code{\link{get_clusters}}.}

\item{tpath}{A character string indicating the path to the project
directory. If the directory is
missing, it will be stored in the Temp directory.}
}
\value{
Return three data sets in the current directory including:
 \itemize{
 \item{unfilteredPPIs} - Unfiltered interactions
 \item{ppi_input_ClusterOne} - ClusterONE input that includes
 High-confidence interactions defined by user-defined threshold.
 \item{predicted_cpx} - predicted complexes resulted from partitioning
 the high-confidence network.}
}
\description{
This function first begins by executing several
pre-processing steps to improve the quality of the raw data, followed
by concatenating the co-elution profiles of putative interacting
proteins. Concatenated profiles and class labels generated
from reference complexes are then fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
deep learning model. These models then generate a weighted protein
interaction network in which edge weights between protein nodes represent
the deep learning modelâ€™s probability estimate for interaction.
High-confidence PPIs based on the user-defined threshold is then will be
partitioned via ClusterONE algorithm.
