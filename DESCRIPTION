Description: Co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) has emerged as a powerful approach 
    for cell-wide identification of protein complexes that performs nearly all
    biological processes and cellular activities. While computational tools based 
    on traditional machine learning is widely applied to analyze protein complexes, 
    it remains unclear if it is the most suitable choice for analyzing CF/MS 
    dataset. Here, we introduce deepCE, a R/Bioconductor package that employs deep 
    learning approaches for automated scoring of co-fractionation mass spectrometry 
    (CF-MS) and sophisticated clustering procedure for network inference of 
    underlying complexes.
